# time_series_forecasting

## Multiple Time Series Forecasting using VAR, ARIMA models and testing for Granger Causality:

In this notebook, we will compare VAR and ARIMA model to forecast daily new COVID-19 cases for top 5 countries and test for possible causality to see if including time series data from other countries significantly improves the prediction of other based on pairwise F-test score. 

The dataset is stored in csv file format as 'time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv'
